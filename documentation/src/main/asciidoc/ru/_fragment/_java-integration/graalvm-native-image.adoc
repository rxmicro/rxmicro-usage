=== Using GraalVM to Build Native Image

https://www.graalvm.org/[GraalVM^] is a universal virtual machine for running applications written in different languages.

GraalVM contains a https://www.graalvm.org/docs/reference-manual/native-image/[Native Image Tool^], which allows you to ahead-of-time compile Java code to a standalone executable, called a native image.

GraalVM Native Image Tool can be used to build a native image of any RxMicro microservice project.
Before build a native image it is necessary to setup GraalVM developer environment.
