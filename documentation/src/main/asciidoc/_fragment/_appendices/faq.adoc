=== Appendix A: FAQ

This section covers a list of possible questions that You can ask yourself when You use the RxMicro framework.

==== Does the RxMicro framework modify my byte code?

No.
Your classes are Your classes.
The RxMicro framework does not transform classes or modify the Java byte code You write.
The RxMicro framework produces additional classes only.

==== Can the RxMicro framework be used for purposes other than microservices?

Yes.
The RxMicro framework is very modular and You can choose to use any module You need.

==== Why I receive `class not found` error?

When You use the RxMicro framework You can receive one of the following errors:

* `Class rxmicro.$$RestControllerAggregatorImpl not found`;
* `Class rxmicro.$$RestClientFactoryImpl not found`;
* `Class rxmicro.$$RepositoryFactoryImpl not found`;
* `Class rxmicro.$$BeanFactoryImpl not found`;

These errors mean that the `RxMicro Annotation Processor` does not generate the required additional classes.

To fix it, please verify that:

. `pom.xml` for Your project contains <<{quick-start}#quick-start-maven-compiler-plugin-settings-section,the valid settings for `maven-compiler-plugin`>> and
. You executed command: `mvn clean compile`!

==== Why I receive `The Kotlin standard library is not found in the module graph` error?

Sometimes this issue occurs during the work with java code using IntelliJ IDEA.
To fix this issue it is necessary to rebuild Your project: `Build` -> `Rebuild project`.

==== Why I receive `java.lang.NullPointerException: autoRelease couldn't be null` error during unit testing?

If You declare an alternative of the `HttpClientFactory` mock and don't configure it this error can happen.

To fix this issue it is necessary to configure the `@Mock` annotation:

[source,java]
----
include::{RX-MICRO-USAGE-ROOT-LOCAL-PATH}code-fragments/src/test/java/io/rxmicro/examples/code/fragments/NullPointerExceptionAutoReleaseFix.java[tag=content,indent=0]
----
<1> Set `Answers.RETURNS_DEEP_STUBS` as answer value.

==== Why I receive `java.lang.reflect.InaccessibleObjectException: Unable to make MicroServiceTest() accessible: module module.name does not "opens test.package" to unnamed module` error during unit testing?

If `test.package` name matches to the `production.package` name, then You need just to add `io.rxmicro.annotation.processor.RxMicroTestsAnnotationProcessor` annotation processor.
(Read more at <<{quick-start}#testing-prepare-maven-compiler-plugin-settings-section>>).

If `test.package` name does not match to the `production.package` name, then You need configure the `maven-surefire-plugin` manually:

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
    <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>${maven-surefire-plugin.version}</version>
    <configuration>
        <argLine>
            @{argLine}
            --add-opens module.name/test.package=ALL-UNNAMED <!--1-->
        </argLine>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
----
<1> Opens all classes from `test.package` package defined at the `module.name` module to all unnamed modules!
