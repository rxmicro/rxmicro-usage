====
When compiling, the RxMicro framework searches for `RxMicro Annotations` in the source code and generates additional classes necessary for the integral work of the microservice.

*When changing the `RxMicro Annotations` in the source code, DON'T FORGET to recompile the ALL source code, not just the changed file, for the changes to take effect:* `mvn clean compile`.
