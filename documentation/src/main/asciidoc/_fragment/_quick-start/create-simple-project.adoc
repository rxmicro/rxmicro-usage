=== Creating a Project

For creating a project, it is recommended to use a modern IDE, for example https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[IntelliJ IDEA^]

==== Using the `IntelliJ IDEA`

To create a new project, proceed as follows: `File` -> `New` -> `Project` or `Create a New Project`.

In the appeared dialog box select the `Maven` type, make sure that `Project SDK` version 11 or higher will be used, remove the `Create from archetype` checkbox and click `Next`.

In the appeared dialog box type `Name`, `Location` (if the default value is wrong) and `GroupId`
(if the default value is wrong), and click `Finish`.

As a result, IntelliJ IDEA will generate the following project template using maven settings:

[[image-basic-project-template-inline]]

After creating the standard template, activate the `Enable Auto-Import` option.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If for some reason the `IntelliJ IDEA` or another IDE You use for Java coding (e.g. `Eclipse` or `NetBeans`) has generated another project template, delete unnecessary files, create un-created folders and leave only the following sections in `pom.xml`: `modelVersion, groupId, artifactId, version`.

As a result, Your template should fully match the template: <<image-basic-project-template-inline>>.
====

==== Using the Terminal

It is possible to create a new maven project without using the IDE.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If You don't intend to write the source code of a project in notepad, but rather use the IDE to do this, You should directly create a maven project using the IDE.
====

To do this, open the terminal and run the following command:

[source,text,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*mvn* archetype:generate -DgroupId=io.rxmicro.examples -DartifactId=quick-start -DinteractiveMode=false
----

include::../___notes/run-maven-in-terminal-note.adoc[]

As a result, the `quick-start` folder with the basic project template will be created in the current folder.
After that, the created project must be imported into the IDE.

[IMPORTANT]
====
By default, `mvn archetype:generate` doesn't generate an empty project, but a project with two `App` and `AppTest` classes, as well as a connected junit library of `3.8.1` version in `pom.xml`.
The specified classes and dependencies should be deleted before performing the following steps of this guide.

As a result, Your template should fully match the template: <<image-basic-project-template-inline>>.
====

==== Using Other IDE

Creating the simplest project with other IDEs does not differ much from creating it with IntelliJ IDEA. When creating, You should also specify `maven archetype, groupId, artifactId and version`.

The main thing is that after creation *Your project template should fully match the template: <<image-basic-project-template-inline>>*.
