=== Verifying the Microservice

To receive the `"Hello World!"` message from the created REST-based microservice, execute `GET` request to `localhost:8080` endpoint:

[source,text,subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes+"]
----
:$ *curl* -v localhost:8080

* Rebuilt URL to: localhost:8080/
*   Trying 127.0.0.1...
* TCP_NODELAY set
* Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 8080 (#0)

> GET / HTTP/1.1 <1>
> Host: localhost:8080
> User-Agent: curl/7.58.0
> Accept: */*
>

< HTTP/1.1 200 OK <2>
< Server: RxMicro-NettyServer/{RXMICRO-VERSION}
< Date: Thu, 2 Jan 2020 11:48:13 GMT
< Content-Type: application/json
< Content-Length: 25
< Request-Id: 62jJeu8x1310662
<
* Connection #0 to host localhost left intact
*{"message":"Hello World!"}* <3>
----
<1> *curl* sends a GET request.
<2> HTTP server successfully returns a response.
<3> The HTTP body contains a JSON response with the `"Hello World!"` message.

Therefore, the created REST-based microservice works correctly!

[NOTE]
====
You can also use Your favorite browser instead of `curl` to verify if the REST-based microservice is working correctly.
