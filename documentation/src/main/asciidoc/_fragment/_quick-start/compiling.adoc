=== Compiling the Project

==== Using the `maven`

To compile a project using the `maven`, open the terminal in the project root folder and proceed with the following command:

[source,text,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
*mvn* clean compile
----

include::../___notes/run-maven-in-terminal-note.adoc[]

It is possible to compile the project with `maven` even without using the terminal.
Since any modern IDE for Java contains built-in `maven`, You can use this built-in `maven` tool.

To do this, open the `maven panel` and execute the specified commands with a mouse or touchpad manipulator.
For example, the `maven panel` in IntelliJ IDEA looks like:

After successful compilation, the `RxMicro Annotation Processor` work results are displayed in the terminal:

[source,text,subs="verbatim,quotes"]

[TIP]
====
In the `target` folder You can find all generated and compiled classes of the microservice project.

To understand how the RxMicro framework works, please go to <<{core}#core-how-it-works-section>> section.

==== Using the `IntelliJ IDEA`

The IntelliJ IDEA allows annotation processors to be launched automatically when building a project.
So if You want to compile a microservice project using IntelliJ IDEA rather than `maven`, You need to set up the `Annotation Processors` section in the IntelliJ IDEA.

===== Enable Annotation Processing

To enable annotation processing while building a project with IntelliJ IDEA, You need to set up the `Annotation Processors` section.
To do so, open the menu: `File` -> `Settings` and get to the tab:`Build, Execution, Deployment` -> `Compiler` -> `Annotation Processors`.

[WARNING]
====
Make sure that *all* Your settings of the `Annotation Processors` section correspond to the settings shown in the figure above.
====

===== Rebuilding the Project

After setting up the `Annotation Processors` section, the project must be rebuilt.
To do so, run the following command from the main menu: `Build` -> `Rebuild project`.
