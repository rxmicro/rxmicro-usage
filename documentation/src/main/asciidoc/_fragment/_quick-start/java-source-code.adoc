=== Creating the Source Code

The source code of the simplest REST-based microservice consists of one module, one package and two classes.
The source code of each of these components is described below.

==== A `module-info.java` Descriptor

Java 9 has introduced the {WHAT-IS-JPMS-LINK}[`JPMS`^].

Therefore, the RxMicro framework, which requires the use of https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/11/[JDK 11^] or higher, requires a `module-info.java` descriptor for any of Your microservice projects.

[source,java]
----
include::{RX-MICRO-USAGE-ROOT-LOCAL-PATH}examples/quick-start/src/main/java/module-info.java[tag=content]
----
<1> Module for building REST-based microservices based on HTTP server that uses
https://netty.io/[Netty^], with all required transitive dependencies.
<2> Module for converting a Java model to https://www.json.org/[JSON^]
format and vice versa, with all required transitive dependencies.

[TIP]
====
Usually `module-info.java` depends on all RxMicro modules listed in the `dependencies` section of the `pom.xml`
file of any of Your microservice projects.
Therefore, it is enough to duplicate all the dependencies in `module-info.java`.

_Thanks to the transitive dependencies of the RxMicro framework, the number of modules required has been greatly reduced_.
_Only basic RxMicro modules must be specified!_

==== An HTTP Response Model Class

[source,java]
----
include::{RX-MICRO-USAGE-ROOT-LOCAL-PATH}examples/quick-start/src/main/java/io/rxmicro/examples/quick/start/Response.java[tag=content]
----

[TIP]
====
According to the https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/type.html[specification^], JSON format supports the following data types: object, array and primitives: strings, logical type, numeric type and `null`.

To simplify communication between REST-based microservices, the RxMicro framework supports only *JSON object* as a return type of any REST-based microservice.
Thus, any REST-based microservice built via the RxMicro framework can return *only JSON objects*.
In case You need to return a primitive or an array, *You need to create a wrapper class*.

Therefore, to display the `"Hello World!"` string, it is necessary to create a `Response` wrapper class, which is a wrapper above the string data type.

==== A REST-Based Microservice Class

[source,java]
----
include::{RX-MICRO-USAGE-ROOT-LOCAL-PATH}examples/quick-start/src/main/java/io/rxmicro/examples/quick/start/HelloWorldMicroService.java[tag=content]
----

<1> REST-based microservice contains a handler of HTTP GET method: `sayHelloWorld`, which doesn't accept any parameters and returns a
{JDK-JAVA-BASE-DOC-ROOT-URL}java/util/concurrent/CompletableFuture.html[`CompletableFuture`^] reactive type.
<2> The {JDK-JAVA-BASE-DOC-ROOT-URL}java/util/concurrent/CompletableFuture.html#supplyAsync(U)[`CompletableFuture.supplyAsync()`]
static method is used to create an object of `CompletableFuture` class.
<3> To launch a REST-based microservice the `main` method is used.
<4> The launch is performed using the
{RX-MICRO-SRC-ROOT-BLOB-URL}rxmicro-rest-server/src/main/java/io/rxmicro/rest/server/RxMicro.java#L83[`RxMicro.startRestServer()`^]
static method, which requires the REST-based microservice class as parameter.

[NOTE]
====
Note that the HTTP request handler method doesn't need to be `public`.

The `protected` and `<default>` modifiers are also supported by the RxMicro framework.

The above-mentioned components of the microservice project should be located in the project according to the following screenshot:
