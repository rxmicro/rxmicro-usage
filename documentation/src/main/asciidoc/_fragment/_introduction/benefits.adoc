=== RxMicro Benefits

The RxMicro framework provides the following benefits:

* Declarative programming using annotations.
* CDI by demand.
* Human readable generated code.
* Verifier of the redundant and inefficient source code.
* Runtime without `reflection`.
* Fast startup time.
* Reduced memory footprint.

These benefits are gained due to:

* using of {JDK-JAVA-COMPILER-DOC-ROOT-URL}javax/annotation/processing/Processor.html[*Java annotation processors*^], which generates standard code based on `RxMicro Annotations`;
* replacing standard Java libraries that require `reflection` for their work with analogs that do not need `reflection`;
* using of https://netty.io/[*Netty*^] as the primary NIO framework for *non-blocking asynchronous IO operations*;
* generation of low-level code avoiding unnecessary abstractions and proxies.
