==== `@RollbackChanges` Annotation

The `@RollbackChanges` annotation starts a new transaction before initialization of database by the `@InitialDataSet` annotation (if it is present) and rolls back this transaction after comparing actual database state with expected one provided by the `@ExpectedDataSet` annotation (if it is present).

The isolation level of the test transaction can be configured using `isolationLevel` parameter declared at the `@RollbackChanges` annotation.
