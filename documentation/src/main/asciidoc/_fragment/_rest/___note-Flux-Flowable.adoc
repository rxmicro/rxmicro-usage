[NOTE]
====
The
{REACTOR-CORE-DOC-ROOT-URL}reactor/core/publisher/Flux.html[`Flux`^] and
{RX-JAVA-DOC-ROOT-URL}io/reactivex/Flowable.html[`Flowable`^]
types are developed to handle data stream that may arrive within a certain period of time.

For such cases the HTTP protocol provides the special https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Transfer-Encoding[`Transfer-Encoding`^] mechanism.

But this mechanism is not supported by the RxMicro framework yet, so the
{REACTOR-CORE-DOC-ROOT-URL}reactor/core/publisher/Flux.html[`Flux`^] and
{RX-JAVA-DOC-ROOT-URL}io/reactivex/Flowable.html[`Flowable`^]
types cannot be used in the HTTP request handler.
