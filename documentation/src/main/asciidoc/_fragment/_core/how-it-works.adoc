=== How It Works?

The RxMicro framework uses the
{JDK-JAVA-COMPILER-DOC-ROOT-URL}javax/annotation/processing/Processor.html[Java annotation processor^], which generates standard code using `RxMicro Annotations`.

Thus, the RxMicro framework is a framework of declarative programming.

Using the RxMicro framework, the developer focuses on writing the business logic of a microservice.
Then he configures the desired standard behavior with `RxMicro Annotations`.
When compiling a project, the `RxMicro Annotation Processor` generates additional classes.
Generated classes contain a standard logic that ensures the functionality of the created microservice.
