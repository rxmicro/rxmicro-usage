[[core-rx-micro-json-section]]
=== JSON

https://www.json.org/[*JSON*^] is a widely used message exchange format for distributed applications.

RxMicro provides the `rxmicro.json` module for low-level and efficient work with this format.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The RxMicro framework uses classes from the `rxmicro.json` module when automatically converting Java models to JSON format and vice versa.

*Therefore, a developer should not explicitly use this module!*

_However, the common idea about the capabilities of this module is needed for correct test writing!_
