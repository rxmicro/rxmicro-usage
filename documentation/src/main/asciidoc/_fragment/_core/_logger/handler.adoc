==== Logger Handler

By default the `INFO` logging level is activated for the all logger.

All logger events are sent to the {RX-MICRO-SRC-ROOT-BLOB-URL}rxmicro-logger/src/main/java/io/rxmicro/logger/jul/SystemOutConsoleHandler.java[`SystemOutConsoleHandler`^] appender, which outputs all logging information into `System.out`.

[TIP]
====
The `rxmicro.logger` module follows the logs recommendations, that are defined at https://12factor.net/logs[The Twelve-Factor App Manifest^] and logs messages to `System.out` only!

If these functions are not enough You can use any other logging framework:
http://logback.qos.ch/[`Logback`^],
https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/[`Apache Log4j 2`^] and others.
