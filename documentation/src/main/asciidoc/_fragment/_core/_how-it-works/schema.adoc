==== A Common Work Schema

The common work schema can be presented as follows:

.The RxMicro framework common work schema.

While solving a business task, the developer writes `Micro service source code`.
Then the developer configures the desired standard microservice behavior via `RxMicro annotations`.
After that, the developer compiles the project.

Since the `RxMicro Annotation Processor` is configured in `maven`, when compiling a project this processor handles the source code of the microservice and generates the additional classes: `Micro service generated code`.
After that, the compiler compiles the source and generated microservice codes: `Micro service byte code` and `Micro service generated byte code`.

The compiled source and generated codes along with the `RxMicro runtime libraries` perform useful work.

[IMPORTANT]
====
*All `RxMicro annotations` are only available during compilation!*

The compiled byte code of microservices *does not contain* `RxMicro annotations`:

.Decompiled REST-based microservice class.

Therefore, libraries with annotation classes may be missing while REST-based microservice is running.

*It is especially important for features which are performed only at the build time (for example, generation of the project documentation).*
