==== Generating of Additional Classes.

Let's have a look at the <<core-how-it-works-core-schema,RxMicro framework common work schema>>, by the example of the REST-based microservice project, which displays the `"Hello World!"` message in JSON format. +
_(This project was considered in the <<{quick-start}#quick-start-section>> section.)_

While implementing a business task (in this example, it's a task of displaying the `"Hello World!"` message in JSON format) the developer wrote the following `Micro service source code`:

image::core/how-it-work/micro-src.jpg[]

In order to inform the RxMicro framework about the need to generate additional classes by which a written `Micro service source code` can be built into an HTTP server to handle the desired HTTP requests, the developer added the following `RxMicro annotation`:

[source,java]
----
include::{RX-MICRO-USAGE-ROOT-LOCAL-PATH}code-fragments/src/main/java/io/rxmicro/examples/code/fragments/MicroService.java[tag=get-annotation,indent=0]
----

Since the `RxMicro Annotation Processor` is configured in maven:

[source,xml]
----
<configuration>
    <annotationProcessors>
        <annotationProcessor>
            io.rxmicro.annotation.processor.RxMicroAnnotationProcessor
        </annotationProcessor>
    </annotationProcessors>
</configuration>
----

then when compiling a project this processor handles the source code of the REST-based microservice and generates the `Micro service generated code` additional classes:

image::core/how-it-work/micro-gen-src.jpg[]

After the source code of additional classes was successfully generated by the annotation processor, the compiler compiles:

* REST-based microservice source code in `Micro service byte code`:

image::core/how-it-work/micro-byte.jpg[]

* Generated code of additional classes in `Micro service byte code`:

image::core/how-it-work/micro-gen-byte.jpg[]

As a result of the compiler's work, the REST-based microservice byte code and the byte code of the generated additional classes will be stored jointly in the same `jar` archive:

image::core/how-it-work/all-byte.jpg[]

For successful start of the compiled classes, the `RxMicro runtime libraries` are required:

image::core/how-it-work/rxmicro-runtime-libs.jpg[]

The `Micro service byte code`, `Micro service byte code` and `RxMicro runtime libraries` are the program components of microservice, which perform useful work.

Below we will look closely at each generated additional class and what functions it performs.

[TIP]
====
The names of all classes generated by the RxMicro framework start with the `$$` prefix.
====

===== An Additional Class for the REST Controller.

Any REST-based microservice, contains at least one REST controller.
For the simplest project, REST-based microservice and REST controller are the same class.

Therefore, when analyzing such projects, such terms as *REST controller*, *REST-based microservice* and *microservice* are synonymous, because physically they are the same class.

The considered REST-based microservice, which displays the `"Hello World!"` message, is the simplest project, therefore the `HelloWorldMicroService` class is a REST controller.

[NOTE]
====
For more information on the differences between *REST controller*, *REST-based microservice* and *microservice*, refer to the <<{microservice}#microservice-section>> section.
====

For each REST controller class the RxMicro framework generates an additional class that performs the following functions:

* Creates a REST controller object. +
_(In case of <<{cdi}#cdi-section,`rxmicro.cdi`>> module activation, after creation it also injects the required dependencies.)_
* Creates `ModelReader` objects that convert HTTP request parameters, headers and body to Java model.
* Creates `ModelWriter` objects that convert the Java response model to HTTP response headers and body;
* Registers all HTTP request handlers of current REST controller in the router.
* When receiving an HTTP request via the `ModelReader` object, converts the HTTP request to the Java request model and invokes the corresponding REST controller handler.
* After receiving the resulting Java response model via the `ModelWriter` object, converts the Java model into an HTTP response and sends the response to the client.

Such an additional class for the `HelloWorldMicroService` class is the `$$HelloWorldMicroService` class:

[source,java]
----
public final class $$HelloWorldMicroService extends AbstractRestController {

    private HelloWorldMicroService restController;

    private $$ResponseModelWriter responseModelWriter;

    @Override
    protected void postConstruct() {
        restController = new HelloWorldMicroService(); // <1>
        responseModelWriter =
                new $$ResponseModelWriter(restServerConfig.isHumanReadableOutput()); // <2>
    }

    @Override
    public void register(final RestControllerRegistrar registrar) { // <3>
        registrar.register(
                this,
                new Registration(
                        "",
                        "sayHelloWorld()",
                        this::sayHelloWorld, // <4>
                        false,
                        new ExactUrlRequestMappingRule( // <5>
                                "GET",
                                "/",
                                false
                        )
                )
        );
    }

    private CompletionStage<HttpResponse> sayHelloWorld(final PathVariableMapping mapping,
                                                        final HttpRequest request) {
        return restController.sayHelloWorld() // <6>
                .thenApply(response -> buildResponse(response, 200)); // <7>
    }

    private HttpResponse buildResponse(final Response model,
                                       final int statusCode) {
        final HttpResponse response = httpResponseBuilder.build();
        response.setStatus(statusCode);
        responseModelWriter.write(model, response); // <8>
        return response;
    }

}
----
<1> The `$$HelloWorldMicroService` component creates an instance of the REST controller class.
<2> The `$$HelloWorldMicroService` component creates an instance of the `ModelWriter` that converts the Java response model to the HTTP response headers and body.
<3> The `$$HelloWorldMicroService` component registers all HTTP request handlers of the current REST controller.
<4> The registration object contains a link to the HTTP request handler of the current REST controller.
<5> The registration object contains a rule, according to which the router determines whether to invoke this HTTP request handler.
<6> When receiving HTTP request, the `$$HelloWorldMicroService` invokes REST controller method.
<7> After invoking the REST controller method, an asynchronous result handler is added. +
_(When using the reactive approach, <<core-dont-block-current-thread,the current thread cannot be blocked>>, so the
{JDK-JAVA-BASE-DOC-ROOT-URL}java/util/concurrent/CompletionStage.html#thenApply(java.util.function.Function)[`thenApply`^] method is used for delayed result handling.)_
<8> After receiving the Java response model object, the result handler creates an HTTP response based on the data received from the model, which is subsequently sent to the client.

===== An `ModelWriter` Class.

To convert a Java model to an HTTP response, You will need a separate component that performs the following functions:

* Defines in what format to return an HTTP response depending on the project settings.
* Creates converter objects that support the specified messaging format.
* When converting a Java model to an HTTP response, manages the conversion process by delegating invocations to the appropriate components.

Such a separate component for the `Response` model class is the `$$ResponseModelWriter` class:

[TIP]
====
The code of the `$$ResponseModelWriter` generated class depends on the response model class structure, and the format used for message exchange with the client.

Since the format of message exchange with the client is set in `module-info.java` of the project (`requires rxmicro.rest.server.exchange.json;`), and is the configuration for all REST controllers and all their handlers, then within the current project, the `$$ResponseModelWriter` will depend only on the response model class structure.

Therefore, if several handlers from different REST controllers will return the `Response` class model, only one `$$ResponseModelWriter` class will be generated.
As a result, in each additional REST controller class, the instance of this class will be used.
====

[source,java]
----
public final class $$ResponseModelWriter extends ModelWriter<Response> {

    private final $$ResponseModelToJsonConverter responseModelToJsonConverter; //<1>

    private final ExchangeDataFormatConverter<Object> exchangeDataFormatConverter; //<2>

    private final String outputMimeType;

    public $$ResponseModelWriter(final boolean humanReadableOutput) {
        exchangeDataFormatConverter =
            new JsonExchangeDataFormatConverter(humanReadableOutput); // <3>
        responseModelToJsonConverter = new $$ResponseModelToJsonConverter();
        outputMimeType = exchangeDataFormatConverter.getMimeType();
    }

    @Override
    public void write(final Response model,
                      final HttpResponse response) {
        final Map<String, Object> json = responseModelToJsonConverter.toJsonObject(model); // <4>
        response.setHeader(HttpHeaders.CONTENT_TYPE, outputMimeType); //<5>
        response.setContent(exchangeDataFormatConverter.toBytes(json)); //<6>
    }

}
----
<1> Since the JSON message exchange format is specified in the settings, a component that can convert the Java response model to a JSON response model is required.
_(This task is specific for each response model, so to avoid using `reflection`, You need to generate a separate converter component.)_
<2> To convert any low-level model (in this example, it's a JSON response model) into a byte array, You also need a separate converter component.
<3> Since the JSON messaging format is specified in the settings, it is assumed that the JSON model will be converted to an byte array, which will be created from the Java response model.
<4> When the HTTP response is formed, it is necessary to convert Java response model to JSON model.
<5> Since the JSON message exchange format is specified in the settings, it is necessary to set the HTTP header: `Content-Type = application/json`.
<6> The last step is to convert the JSON model to a byte array, that will be written to the HTTP response body.

===== A Java Model Converter.

To avoid using `reflection`, You need a component that can convert Java model to JSON model.

This component must support the following functions:

* Convert Java model to JSON model of any complexity.
* Support all possible class field access models to be an all-purpose tool. +
_(Supported class field access models are described in details in the <<core-encapsulation>>.)_

Such a separate component for the `Response` model class is the `$$ResponseModelToJsonConverter` class:

[source,java]
----
public final class $$ResponseModelToJsonConverter extends ModelToJsonConverter<Response> {

    @Override
    // <1>
    public Map<String, Object> toJsonObject(final Response model) {
        return new JsonObjectBuilder()
                .put("message", model.message) // <2>
                .build();
    }

}
----

<1> JSON object is presented as `Map<String, Object>`. +
_(More information about JSON format support by the RxMicro framework can be found in the <<core-rx-micro-json-section>>.)_
<2> The value of the `message` field is read from the Java model by direct reference to the field. +
_(Supported class field access models are described in details in the <<core-encapsulation>>.)_

===== An Aggregator of the REST Controllers.

To integrate developer code into the RxMicro framework infrastructure, You need aggregators.

The aggregators perform the following functions:

* Register all generated additional classes for REST controllers;
* Customize the runtime environment;

The aggregators are invoked by the RxMicro framework using `reflection`. +
_(That' s why aggregators have a permanent and predefined names and are located in the special package: `rxmicro`.)_

*An Aggregator of the REST Controllers for any project is always the `rxmicro.$$RestControllerAggregatorImpl` class*:

[source,java]
----
package rxmicro; //<1>

public final class $$RestControllerAggregatorImpl extends RestControllerAggregator { // <2>

    static {
        $$EnvironmentCustomizer.customize(); // <3>
    }

    protected List<AbstractMicroService> listAllRestControllers() {
        return List.of(
                new io.rxmicro.examples.quick.start.$$HelloWorldMicroService() // <4>
        );
    }

}
----
<1> All aggregators are *always* generated in the special package: `rxmicro`.
<2> The predefined name of the REST controller aggregator class is always `$$RestControllerAggregatorImpl`.
<3> When the aggregator class is loaded by the RxMicro framework, the component of the <<core-how-it-works-environment-customizer,current environment customization>> is invoked.
<4> The aggregator registers all generated additional classes for REST controllers;

[[core-how-it-works-environment-customizer]]
===== An Environment Customizer.

Java 9 has introduced the https://www.oracle.com/corporate/features/understanding-java-9-modules.html[JPMS^].

This system requires that a developer configures access to classes in the *module-info.java* file of the microservice project.

To enable the RxMicro framework to load aggregator classes, You must export the `rxmicro` package to the `rxmicro.runtime` module:

[source,java]
----
module examples.quick.start {
    requires rxmicro.rest.server.netty;
    requires rxmicro.rest.server.exchange.json;

    exports rxmicro to rxmicro.runtime; // <1>
}
----
<1>  Allow access of classes from the `rxmicro.runtime` module to all classes from the `rxmicro` package.

But the `rxmicro` package is created automatically and after deleting all the generated files, it won't be possible to compile the `module-info.java` because of the following error:

`package is empty or does not exist: rxmicro`.

To solve this problem, the RxMicro generates the `rxmicro.$$EnvironmentCustomizer` class:

[source,java]
----
final class $$EnvironmentCustomizer {

    static {
        addExportsToRuntime(); // <1>
    }

    public static void customize() {
        //do nothing. All customization is done at the static section
    }

    private static void addExportsToRuntime() {
        final Module currentModule = $$EnvironmentCustomizer.class.getModule();
        currentModule.addExports("rxmicro", getRuntimeModule()); // <2>
    }

}
----
<1> When the class is loaded, the `addExportsToRuntime()` static method is invoked.
<2> In this method body, the export of the `rxmicro` package to the `rxmicro.runtime` module is performed dynamically using the capabilities of the {JDK-JAVA-BASE-DOC-ROOT-URL}java/lang/Module.html[`java.lang.Module`^] class.

Due to this additional class, all necessary settings for the https://www.oracle.com/corporate/features/understanding-java-9-modules.html[JPMS^] are created automatically.

[TIP]
====
If the RxMicro framework needs additional automatic settings for its correct work, these settings will be automatically added by the `RxMicro Annotation Processor` to the `rxmicro.$$EnvironmentCustomizer` class.
