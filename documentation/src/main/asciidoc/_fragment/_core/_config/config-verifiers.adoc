==== Configuration Verifiers

If Your runtime has complex configuration the RxMicro team strong recommends enabling runtime strict mode.

If the runtime strict mode activated the RxMicro runtime invokes additional checks to find unused or redundant configurations.

To enable the runtime strict mode set `RX_MICRO_RUNTIME_STRICT_MODE` environment variable to the `true` value!
_(Instead of environment variable You can use Java System property as well.)_

If runtime strict mode successful activated the following log message can be found:

[source,text]

[INFO] RxMicroRuntime !!! RxMicro Runtime Strict Mode is activated !!!
