===== Configuration Using Java Classes.

Configuring with Java classes is the easiest and most explicit configuration method:

[source,java]
----
public static void main(final String[] args) {
    new Configs.Builder()
            .withConfigs(new HttpServerConfig()
                    .setPort(9090)) // <1>
            .build();
    startRestServer(MicroService.class);
}
----
<1> Changing the HTTP server port.

[source,text]
----
2020-01-02 18:49:58.372 [INFO] io.rxmicro.rest.server.netty.internal.component.NettyServer :
Server started at 0.0.0.0:9090 using NETTY transport in 500 millis. # <1>
----
<1> The HTTP server has started at the `9090` port instead of the standard `8080` port.

[IMPORTANT]
====
*The main difference between this type of configuration and the others is that when using Java classes, other configuration sources are always ignored!*
====

*Therefore this type is recommended to be used ONLY for test purposes!*

(_It does not have enough flexibility for the production environment!_)

*For the production environment, use the configuration with annotations instead of the configuration with Java classes!*
