=== Logger

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_logger[*Logger*^] is an integral component of any software system.

The RxMicro framework provides the `rxmicro.logger` module for logging important events during the work of microservices.

Creation and usage of a logger in the source code is no different from http://www.java-logging.com/[other logging frameworks^]:

----
<1> Logger creation for the current microservice class.
<2> Logging of a message with `INFO` message.

The {RX-MICRO-SRC-ROOT-BLOB-URL}rxmicro-logger/src/main/java/io/rxmicro/logger/Logger.java[`Logger`^] interface is an abstraction over the real logger.

At the moment, there is only one implementation of this interface that delegates logging to the
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/core/java-logging-overview.htm[`java.logging`^] module.
